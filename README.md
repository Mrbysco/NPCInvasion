# NPC Invasion #

## About ##
NPC Invasion is a mod that introduces the possibility of altering in-game sounds using phrases inspired by the TikTok NPC trend. You have the flexibility to configure which sounds may be overwritten. By default, there is a 1% chance that the Creeper Primed sound will be replaced by one of the NPC phrases.
